# Art-Industry-Analysis
This code models work that might be assigned to a data scientist by an art auction house. It utilizes two csv files (Data.csv and Art.csv). One with 91 paintings and information about them, the other ratings and information from 300 users. This required data cleaning, regression analysis and different classifications among many other things. The project report includes written analysis as well as modeling.
